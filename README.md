Server Requirements
PHP version 5.6 or newer is recommended.

It should work on 5.3.7 as well, but we strongly advise you NOT to run
such old versions of PHP, because of potential security and performance
issues, as well as missing features.
Application Server

You can choose to install any of the following Application Server: LAMP, MAMP, XAMMP.
